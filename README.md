# Secure Coding Review using SonarQube

This project focuses on performing a secure coding review on Pknowledge's basic Python project using SonarQube. The review is conducted as part of the third task in the CodeAlpha internship.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in the Python codebase using SonarQube, a powerful static code analysis tool. By leveraging SonarQube, we aim to enhance the overall security and maintainability of the code.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **SonarQube:** A static code analysis tool that detects code quality issues and security vulnerabilities.
- **Python:** The programming language used in the Pknowledge basic project.

## Steps to Perform Secure Coding Review

1. **Set Up SonarQube:**
   - Install and configure SonarQube on your local machine or use a cloud-based instance.
   - Create a new project in SonarQube for the secure coding review.

2. **Analyze Code with SonarQube:**
   - Clone the Pknowledge basic Python project repository.
   - Run SonarQube analysis on the Python codebase to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

3. **Review and Address Findings:**
   - Examine the issues reported by SonarQube and categorize them based on severity.
   - Provide recommendations and implement fixes for the identified vulnerabilities.

## Results and Improvements

- **Vulnerability Detection:** SonarQube identified several security vulnerabilities in the Python codebase, including potential injection flaws and insecure coding practices.
- **Code Quality Enhancement:** The analysis also highlighted areas where code quality could be improved, such as code duplication and complexity.

## Conclusion

By conducting a thorough secure coding review using SonarQube, we were able to identify and address critical security vulnerabilities in the Pknowledge basic Python project. This process not only enhanced the security of the code but also improved its overall quality and maintainability.
